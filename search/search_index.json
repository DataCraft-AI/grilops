This package contains a collection of libraries and helper functions that are useful for solving and checking Nikoli -style logic puzzles using z3. To get a feel for how to use this package to model and solve puzzles, try working through the tutorial IPython notebook , and refer to the examples and the API Documentation . Basic Concepts and Usage The symbols and grids modules contain the core functionality needed for modeling most puzzles. For convenience, their attributes can be accessed directly from the top-level grilops module. Symbols represent the marks that are determined and written into a grid by a solver while solving a puzzle. For example, the symbol set of a Sudoku puzzle would be the digits 1 through 9. The symbol set of a binary determination puzzle such as Nurikabe could contain two symbols, one representing a black cell and the other representing a white cell. A symbol grid is used to keep track of the assignment of symbols to grid cells. Generally, setting up a program to solve a puzzle using grilops involves: Constructing a symbol set Constructing a symbol grid limited to contain symbols from that symbol set Adding puzzle-specific constraints to cells in the symbol grid Checking for satisfying assignments of symbols to symbol grid cells Grid cells are exposed as z3 constants, so built-in z3 operators can and should be used when adding puzzle-specific constraints. In addition, grilops provides several modules to help automate and abstract away the introduction of common kinds of constraints. Loops The grilops.loops module is helpful for adding constraints that ensure symbols connect to form closed loops.

Arguments symbol_grid (SymbolGrid) : The SymbolGrid to check against. start (Tuple[int, int]) : The (y, x) coordinate of the cell where the sightline should begin. This is the first cell checked. direction (Tuple[int, int]) : The (delta-y, delta-x) distance to advance to reach the next cell in the sightline. stop (Callable[[int], BoolRef]) : A function that accepts a symbol as an argument and returns True if we should stop following the sightline when this symbol is encountered. By default, the sightline will continue to the edge of the grid. count (Callable[[int], ArithRef]) : A function that accepts a symbol as an argument and returns the integer value to add to the count when this symbol is encountered. By default, each symbol will count with a value of one. accumulate_and_count_cells accumulate_and_count_cells(symbol_grid:grilops.grids.SymbolGrid, start:Tuple[int, int], direction:Tuple[int, int], stop:Callable[[int, z3.z3.ArithRef], z3.z3.BoolRef]=<function <lambda> at 0x7fa0f70b0c80>, count:Callable[[int, z3.z3.ArithRef], z3.z3.ArithRef]=<function <lambda> at 0x7fa0f70b0e18>, accumulate:Callable[[int, z3.z3.ArithRef], z3.z3.ArithRef]=<function <lambda> at 0x7fa0f70b0ea0>) Returns a computation of a sightline through a grid, with accumulation. Arguments symbol_grid (SymbolGrid) : The SymbolGrid to check against. start (Tuple[int, int]) : The (y, x) coordinate of the cell where the sightline should begin. This is the first cell checked. direction (Tuple[int, int]) : The (delta-y, delta-x) distance to advance to reach the next cell in the sightline. stop (Callable[[int, ArithRef], BoolRef]) : A function that accepts a symbol and an accumulated value as arguments, and returns True if we should stop following the sightline when this symbol is encountered. By default, the sightline will continue to the edge of the grid. count (Callable[[int, ArithRef], ArithRef]) : A function that accepts a symbol and an accumulated value as arguments, and returns the integer value to add to the count when this symbol is encountered. By default, each symbol will count with a value of one. accumulate (Callable[[int, ArithRef], ArithRef]) : A function that accepts a symbol and an accumulated value as arguments, and returns a new accumulated value. This function is used to determine a new accumulated value for each cell along the sightline, based on the accumulated value from the previously encountered cells as well as the symbol in the current cell. The initial accumulated value is zero.","title":"Sightlines"},{"location":"symbols/","text":"grilops.symbols This module supports defining symbols that may be filled into grid cells. Symbol Symbol(self, index:int, name:Union[str, NoneType]=None, label:Union[str, NoneType]=None) A marking that may be filled into a single SymbolGrid cell. Arguments index (int) : The index value assigned to the symbol. name (str, None) : The Python-safe name of the symbol. label (str, None) : The printable label of the symbol. index (int): The index value assigned to the symbol. label (str): The printable label of the symbol. name (str): The Python-safe name of the symbol. SymbolSet SymbolSet(self, symbols:List[Union[str, Tuple[str, str], Tuple[str, str, int]]]) The complete set of markings allowed to be filled into a SymbolGrid . Arguments symbols (List[Union[str, Tuple[str, str], Tuple[str, str, int]]]) : A list of specifications for the symbols. Each specification may be a Python-safe name, a (Python-safe name, printabel label) tuple, or a (Python-safe name, printabel label, index value) tuple. symbols (Dict[int, Symbol]): The map of all symbols. append SymbolSet.append(self, name:str=None, label:str=None) Appends an additional symbol to this symbol set. Arguments name (str, None) : The Python-safe name of the symbol. label (str, None) : The printable label of the symbol. min_index SymbolSet.min_index(self) Returns the minimum index value of all of the symbols. max_index SymbolSet.max_index(self) Returns the maximum index value of all of the symbols. make_letter_range_symbol_set make_letter_range_symbol_set(min_letter:str, max_letter:str) -> grilops.symbols.SymbolSet Returns a SymbolSet consisting of consecutive letters. Arguments min_letter (str) : The lowest letter to include in the set. max_letter (str) : The highest letter to include in the set. Returns (SymbolSet) : A SymbolSet consisting of consecutive letters. make_number_range_symbol_set make_number_range_symbol_set(min_number:int, max_number:int) -> grilops.symbols.SymbolSet Returns a SymbolSet consisting of consecutive numbers. The names of the symbols will be prefixed with S so that they may be referred to directly in Python code. Arguments min_number (int) : The lowest number to include in the set. max_number (int) : The highest number to include in the set. Returns (SymbolSet) : A SymbolSet consisting of consecutive numbers.","title":"Symbols"}]}
